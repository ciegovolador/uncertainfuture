				<h1>Visualizing &quot;The Future According to You&quot;</h1>

				<p>We want to provide a canvas on which you can paint your
				predictions of the future. Not just a passive canvas, but an
				active canvas: one that can hold not just your predictions of
				particular times, but also your predictions about trends and
				changes: a system where you can input your beliefs and watch
				the future move.</p>

				<p>Our questions are designed to take your beliefs as input
				and see what those beliefs imply. We tried to make as few
				assumptions as possible, and we tried to make our assumptions
				as non-controversial as possible; we want the interesting
				parts of the future to come from you.  (We did have to
				introduce some assumptions to simplify our model &mdash; we wanted
				the questionnaire to predict your next sixty years, not to
				take your next sixty years to fill out.  You can see the basic
				thrust of our model <a href="coming-soon.html">here</a>, or
				read the gory math details in
				our <a href="coming-soon.html">gory math FAQ</a>.)</p>

				<p>Besides making our canvas active and giving it room for
				your beliefs, we aim to provide a canvas that can hold your
				full uncertainty.  Most futurism is about telling a single,
				specific story about what might happen. Specific stories are
				great in cases where you know exactly what will happen.
				However, if you're dealing with a wide swath of future
				possibilities and you're a human being, chances are you don't
				know what will happen.  You have some guesses, you know some
				things are more likely than others, but you can't say &quot;In
				September of 2038, John Smith will invent the Such-And-Such
				Widget, which will allow him to build human-level
				AI&quot;.</p>

				<p>In the Uncertain Future, we let you input
				the full range of your uncertainties &mdash; and we show you the
				distribution over futures that your current, uncertain beliefs
				imply.  We help you create your own picture of the uncertain
				future.</p>
