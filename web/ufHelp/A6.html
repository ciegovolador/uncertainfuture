<h2>How your answers were used to produce the timeline above:</h2>

<p>The result from <strong>A5</strong> was the probability that neuromorphic AI has been created at different years. In <strong>Q6</strong> you provided the probability that 
non-neuromorphic AI will be created by various years.</p>

<p><img src="../img/A6.png" alt="Overview of process" /></p>
<p>These probabilities are assumed to be independent in this model and are combined 
to produce the overall probability that AI of either type will be created at 
various points in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">*The probabilities aren't just added, see <a target="_blank" href="../coming-soon.html">math details</a> for more information.</p>
