<h2>How your answers were used to produce the timeline above:</h2>

<p>The timeline of <strong>A8</strong> showed your estimate that a catastrophe of any sort will
halt progress.</p>

<p><strong>A9</strong> displayed the probability of either type of AI having occurred at various times in the future, taking into account effects of intelligence enhancement technologies.</p>

<p><img src="../img/A10.png" alt="Overview of process" /></p>
<p>The information from <strong>A8</strong> and <strong>A9</strong> combined gives the probability for a civilization-scale disruption (either human-level AI or a catastrophe halting all scientific progress) having occurred at various times in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">*The probabilities aren't just added, see <a target="_blank" href="../coming-soon.html">math details</a> for more information.</p>
