	<B>Claim:</B> The
	amount of computing power that can be purchased for a given amount
	of money has doubled roughly every eighteen months since at least
	1960. On May 1st, 2008, at
	the Intel Developers Forum, Pat Gelsinger, the senior vice president and
	co-general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, predicted that this trend will continue through
	2029.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> Given no major disruptions, we can
	expect the regular doubling in available computing hardware per dollar to
	continue through 2029.

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Claim: </B>&quot;In
	terms of size [of transistor] you can see that we're approaching the
	size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier, but it'll be two or
	three generations before we get that far - but that's as far out as
	we've ever been able to see. We have another 10 to 20 years before
	we reach a fundamental limit. Electronics though is a fundamental
	technology that's not likely to be replaced directly. There's a
	difference between making a small machine and connecting them by the

	<B>Claim: </B>&quot;In
