<B>Helpful facts:</B><BR>
<P>Approximately 135 million children are
born per year. On average worldwide, 5 children per 1000 go on to
be researchers. In certain countries
like the United States, 20 per 1000 children become researchers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The total number of

	<B>Claim: </B>Based
	on popular opposition to &quot;designer babies&quot; and
	emerging biotechnologies like human cloning of any type, it is
	unlikely that this practice will catch on, and it may in fact be
	outlawed worldwide, meaning that the number of children conceived
	using this technique through 2070 will be trivial.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Estimates and error bars close to zero.

	<B>Claim:</B> As with other medical
	technologies that were once feared and are now routine, such as the
	dissection of cadavers (300 BC), vaccination (1771), and in vitro
	fertilization (1978), it is likely that the world will largely
	embrace embryo selection, though it may take a few decades. <BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Adoption similar to other widely beneficial reproductive

	<B>Claim:</B> Not only will the

	beneficial that adoption is likely to be fast and widespread,
	similar to the adoption of condoms.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Many millions of families will use the technology to give their
	children better opportunities, and within a couple decades from the
	introduction of the technology, there will be many millions of
	researchers who were born using the technology.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	Attitudes toward genetic testing and
