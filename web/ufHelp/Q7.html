What is the probability
that there will be a nuclear war between now and 2070 so severe that
it sets progress towards human-level AI back decades or centuries? 
For this model, you may set a constant probability per year/decade or
have it go up or down over time at a constant rate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, think about
current political conditions. How likely is nuclear war now? Your
answer for this will go on the left-hand side of the graph, near
2010.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, think about what
conditions may be like in 2070. Maybe nuclear war will become more likely as
weapons technologies proliferate. Maybe nuclear war will become less likely
as global political institutions improve. Your answer for 2070 will
go on the right-hand side of the graph, near 2070.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	Stanford Professor Martin Hellman, who has researched the topic for
	decades, estimates a 1% annual probability of nuclear war between
	major nuclear powers. Reviewing the literature, he found no other
	references on the annual probability of nuclear war. <BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Although 1% is probably more likely than 0.001% or 50%, little
	serious research has been done and probability distributions should
	be wide.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	Between 1956 and 1979, there have been at least 20 mishaps that
	could have led to accidental nuclear war between the US and USSR.
	Even if the chance of each one leading to a war was small, when so
