<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What is the probability that a disaster not related to nuclear weapons will set progress toward human-level AI back decades or centuries? For example, consider runaway climate
change, a biotechnologically engineered plague, self-replicating
nanomachines, economic collapse, a planetary totalitarian government
that restricts technology development, or something unknown.</P>

	<B>Claim: </B>&quot;I
	think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further
	perfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well
	beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to
	nation-states, on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of
	extreme individuals. An immediate consequence of the Faustian
	bargain in obtaining the great power of nanotechnology is that we
	run a grave risk &mdash; the risk that we might destroy the biosphere on
	which all life depends. If our own extinction is a likely, or even
	possible, outcome of our technological development, shouldn't we
	proceed with great caution?&quot;<BR>

	<B>Claim:</B> It's highly unlikely for us,
	as observers, to be among the first tiny fraction of humans ever
	born.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> The total number of humans is probably
	comparable to the number of humans already born, implying a major
	population-limiting catastrophe sometime within the next few
	thousand years. One estimate gives a 95% confidence estimate of a
	0.4% to 0.8% chance of such a catastrophe between now and 2070, or
	about 0.67% - 1.3% per decade if the probability is distributed

	<B>Claim: </B>We may systematically
	underestimate the likelihood of a humanity-destroying disaster
	because of selection effects. Since we're obviously here and alive,
	we necessarily live in a time when a humanity-destroying disaster
	hasn't occurred. It's impossible to learn from catastrophic
	disasters that wipe out humanity, because when they occur, the
	observers are eliminated. So species-destroying threats are always

	<B>Claim: </B>We may underestimate extinction
	risks because they are presented in generalities rather than highly
	detailed, specific scenarios. Psychological studies have
	demonstrated an effect called the conjunction fallacy, in which
	subjects believe that the joint occurrence of two events, A and B,
	is more likely than the occurrence of A (with or without B). For
	instance, the vivid image of nuclear war between the US and China
	over Taiwan may seem more probable than the abstract idea of nuclear
