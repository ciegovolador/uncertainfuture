<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Question 9: Will
Intelligence Enhancement Change the Picture?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Question 9 focuses on
human intelligence enhancement, sometimes called IA (Intelligence
Amplification). Several sub-questions explore one approach to
intelligence enhancement, namely embryo selection, which relies on existing
technologies and well-understood biology. Numerous other possible
approaches exist, such as brain training games,
intelligence-enhancing pharmaceuticals, and brain-computer
interfaces. Any type of IA is important, because it could accelerate
technological progress.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gene sequencing costs
have been dropping exponentially for some time. Here is a graph (from
Kurzweil (2005)) that shows the trend from 1990 to 2004:

	The first human genome cost
	either $3 billion (Human Genome Project) or $300 million (Celera
	Genomics) in 2001, James Watson's genome cost $2 million in 2007,
	and Applied Biosystems sequenced a human genome for $60,000 in two
