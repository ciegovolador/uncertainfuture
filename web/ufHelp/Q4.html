	<B>Claim: </B>Terry
	Sejnowsky, a leading neuroscientist at the Salk Institute, has
	argued that attempts to simulate the brain are &quot;bound to fail,
	because the mind is too mysterious to model&quot;. Other neuroscientists
	have expressed similar sentiments. Brain simulation projects may never really be taken seriously.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> The
	leading project isn't very likely to have more than $10 million at
	its disposal to purchase computers for simulations. However, much
	lower than this is unlikely, as projects like Blue Brain have
	already been granted similar levels of funding.

	<B>Claim: </B>AI would be of great value in
	everything from education to life extension research, from product design
	to helping humans become more rational. The economic and societal
	benefits of AI would be immense. <BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> Those in
	positions to dole out funding will adopt this view and invest
	heavily in neuromorphic AI projects, ultimately investing a similar
	amount as the Human Genome Project, which cost $3 billion, making
	around $500 million available for the computers themselves.
