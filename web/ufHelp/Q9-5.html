<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What is the improvement
curve of all other forms of human intelligence enhancement, such as
smart drugs, brain-computer interfaces, implants, augmented reality,
and neuroengineering? That is, what multiplier will they confer to
scientific progress in the world as a whole?</P>

<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
	<B>Claim: </B>The
	human brain has already been highly optimized by evolution, and
	making further improvements is likely to be very difficult. There is
	evidence that certain neurological diseases, such as schizophrenia,
	are in fact by-products of our large and metabolically hungry
	brains. Further &quot;improvements&quot; to the brain may produce so
	many dangerous side effects that they are untenable. Furthermore,
	restrictions on human experimentation will radically slow human
	intelligence enhancement research. Improvements not based on biology
	are likely to yield relatively small progress gains.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Slow improvements over the course of the century, driven primarily
	by factors such as improved interfaces and usability.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	Though biological and
	pharmaceutical interventions are likely to be held back both by the
	inherent difficulties of biology and restrictions on human
	experimentation, better computer interfaces and displays, including
	augmented and virtual reality, and eventually mind uploading, are
	likely to accelerate scientific research as they are
	adopted.<BR>

	<B>Claim:</B> Significant
	enhancements to human intelligence through biological and
	pharmaceutical interventions are plausible, and are likely to cause
	significant acceleration of scientific research in coming decades.
	These, coupled together with better interfaces, give us reason to expect large gains. The
	finding that 20% of scientists take performance-enhancing drugs for
	non-medical reasons, even when these drugs are just in their
	infancy, shows how much demand there will be when these drugs work
	even better.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Productivity gains by a factor of 10 or more, with ramp-up beginning
	almost immediately.
