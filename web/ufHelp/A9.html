<h2>How your answers were used to produce the timeline above:</h2>

<p>In <strong>A6</strong> you were given your probability for the creation of AI
of either the neuromorphic or non-neuromorphic type by various 
times in the future.</p>

<p>The five subquestions in <strong>Q9</strong> collected information
about the speedup to AI research capabilities that would
result from either iterated embryo selection or other methods of
intelligence enhancement. The speedup factor is used to shorten the time in which your stated distribution of times for AI development is reached,
as though time were running faster. Like elsewhere in The Uncertain
Future, this is done probabilistically. There isn't a single speedup
factor; rather, there is a probability distribution over different
speedup factors that might occur.</p>

<p><strong>A8</strong> showed your estimate that a catastrophe of any sort will
halt progress.</p>

<p><img src="../img/A9.png" width="850px" alt="Overview of process" /></p>
<p>The information from <strong>A8</strong> and <strong>Q9</strong> can be used to amend the probability over time of creating AI to also consider catastrophes that might halt progress in science, and intelligence enhancement technologies that might
speed up research.</p>

<!--Q9-1: Time when possible to sequence an entire human genome for under $1000
Q9-2: Time of arrival of artificial gametes
Q9-3: Contribution by genes to scientific achievement
Q9-4: How widely iterated embryo selection will be accepted (Number of IA scientists created over time)?
Q9-5: Influence of other methods of intelligence enhancement (speedup)?-->
<!--
A9: Artificial intelligence (of the neuromorphic or non-neuromorphic sort) being created at various points in the future, taking into consideration probabilities for science-disrupting catastrophies and intelligence enhancement that speeds AI research.

A6
AI (any type)

A8
Catastrophe (any type)

Q9-1, Q9-2, Q9-3, Q9-4, Q9-5
Speedup due to intelligence enhancement
