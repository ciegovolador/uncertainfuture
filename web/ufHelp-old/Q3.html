<P>How much computing power would be required to simulate a human brain (perhaps at a
abstract level)?  Drag the distribution to reflect your best guess.
This model automatically takes into account your previous answer on
the in-principle feasibility of AI -- answer as though neuromorphic
human-level AI is definitely possible.

	<B>Claim:</B> &quot;The 'Blue Brain' project
	was launched by the Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Switzerland and IBM,
	USA in May, 2005. It aims to build an accurate software replica of a
	neocortical column (include definition of this) within 2-3 years.
	(This was subsequently achieved.-- <EM>ed</EM>.) The column will
	consist of 10,000 morphologically complex neurons with active ionic
	channels. The neurons will be interconnected in a 3-dimensional
	space with 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">7</FONT></SUP>
	-10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">8</FONT></SUP> dynamic
	synapses. This project will thus use a level of simulation that
	attempts to capture the functionality of individual neurons at a
	very detailed level. The simulation is intended to run in real time
	on a computer performing 22.8*10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">12</FONT></SUP>
	flops. Simulating the entire brain in real time at this level of
	detail (which the researchers indicate as a goal for later stages of
	the project) would correspond to circa 2*10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">19</FONT></SUP>
	ops.&quot; <BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> It may require supercomputers
	10,000 times faster than 2008's best to simulate the human brain. If
	hardware costs keep falling exponentially, computers this fast could
	be available around 2035, but if hardware improvements level off, it
	could be much longer, possibly never.
