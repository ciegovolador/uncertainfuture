<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How likely is it that
any type of non-biological human-level Artificial Intelligence is
possible in principle? Include simulations of the human brain

	&quot;Could a machine think?&quot; On the argument advanced here
	only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines,
	namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to
	those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us
	about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs,
	and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.&quot;<BR>

	<B>Implication:</B>
	AIs based on running programs will not work, so non-biological AI in
	general may not be possible.

	people say that computers can never show true intelligence, whatever
