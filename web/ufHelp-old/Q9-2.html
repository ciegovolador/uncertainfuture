<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How long will it be
before we can reliably coax embryonic stem cells in the lab to
develop into gametes (sperm and eggs) without serious abnormalities?
This capability would be useful for embryo selection, both to produce
more eggs and thus embryos to select among, and to enable iterative
embryo selection, a technique which parents could use to
create &quot;designer babies&quot; with traits that from reduced risk of
particular diseases to abilities that contribute to success in
science.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	&quot;Based on published data and theoretical considerations, it is
	probable that human eggs and sperm will be derived partly or
	entirely in vitro from pluripotent stem cells. The pace of
	scientific progress is difficult to predict. Unanticipated findings
	can either accelerate or slow the pace of progress. With this
	caveat, the derivation of human eggs and sperm in vitro from
	pluripotent stem cells, in whole or at least in part, is anticipated
	within 5 to 15 years.&quot; (2008)<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B> The
	technology is likely to arrive between 2013 and 2023.

	&quot;Based upon the expression of several key genes found in oocytes,
	the team concluded that mouse embryonic stem cells were capable of
	being cultured in a laboratory to develop into

	Artificial mouse gametes have already been produced, since at least
	2002. Artificial gametes in humans probably aren't far off.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	&quot;Scientists in the UK have proved that human embryonic stem cells
	can develop in the laboratory into the early forms of cells that
	eventually become eggs or sperm. However, Mr. Aflatoonian stressed
	that there was still a lot of work to be done before the promise of
	these early results could be translated into reality.&quot;
