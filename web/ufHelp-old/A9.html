<h2>How your answers was used to produce the timeline above:</h2>

<p>In <strong>A6</strong> you were provided with your calculated probability that AI
of either the neuromorphic or non-neuromorphic type being created by various 
times in the future.</p>

<p>The five subquestions in <strong>Q9</strong> collected information
about the plausible speedup to AI research capabilities that would
result from either iterated embryo selection or other methods of
intelligence enhancement. The speedup factors is used to increase the
speed at which your stated probabilities of AI development are reached
as though time was running faster. Like elsewhere in the Uncertain
Future, this is done probabilistically. There isn't a single speedup
factor, rather there is a probability distribution over different
speedup factors that might occur.</p>

<p><strong>A8</strong> showed your estimate that a catastrophe of either sort would
halt progress.</p>

<p>The information from <strong>A8</strong> and <strong>Q9</strong> can be used to extend the probability over time of creating AI to also consider catastrophies which might halt progress in science and intelligence enhancement which might
speed up research.</p>

<!--Q9-1: Time when possible to sequence an entire human genome for under $1000
Q9-2: Time of arrival of artificial gametes
Q9-3: Contribution by genes to scientific achievement
Q9-4: How widely iterated embryo selection will be accepted (Number of IA scientists created over time)?
Q9-5: Influence of other methods of intelligence enhancement (speedup)?-->
<!--
A9: Artificial intelligence (of the neuromorphic or non-neuromorphic sort) being created at various points in the future, taking into consideration probabilities for science-disrupting catastrophies and intelligence enhancement that speeds AI research.

A6
AI (any type)

A8
Catastrophe (any type)

Q9-1, Q9-2, Q9-3, Q9-4, Q9-5
Speedup due to intelligence enhancement
