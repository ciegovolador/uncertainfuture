<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in;">Keeping in mind your
given probabilities for genome sequencing costs, how quickly will we learn what
genes tend to make people into good researchers?</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Phrased differently:
how much more productive will individuals created using
multi-generational <I>in vitro</I> embryo selection be when they grow
up, given our knowledge at the time, and given that the technology is
permitted and used? (If you think it won't be, that will be addressed
in the following question.) Consider a productivity of 1 to be
equivalent to that of the average (mean) non embryo-selected
scientist.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that children selected for traits
contributing to research ability may be a minority of children
selected for any reason, but assume that at least some group will
still be selected for traits such as working memory, curiosity, etc,
and state how much more productive they'll be if they
choose to go into research.</P>

	<B>Claim:</B>
	Above a certain level of cognitive
	ability, further increases have minimal value. For instance, the famous
	California Terman study of high-IQ youth failed to include two
	future Nobel laureates in physics because they were somewhat below
	its IQ cutoff for entry.<BR>

	general cognitive function is unlikely to have great effects on
	scientific output.

	<B>Claim:</B>
	The personality trait
	of openness to experience, which involves active imagination,
	aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference
	for variety, and intellectual curiosity, which makes important
	contributions to research ability, is known to be heritable, and
	therefore could be selected for in multi-generational <I>in
	vitro</I> embryo
	selection procedures. Identical and fraternal twins reared apart
	correlated .43 and .23, respectively, for Openness, while identical
	and fraternal twins reared together correlated .51 and .14. This was
	the highest correlation of any of the five major dimensions of
	personality.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	To the extent that psychological Openness correlates to research
	ability, it can be selected for fairly effectively.

	IQ, which contributes to research ability, is at least somewhat

	significantly. However, the impact

	<B>Claim:</B>
	&quot;The
	research, led by Robert Plomin of the Institute of Psychiatry in
	London, identified six genes that were strongly associated with high
	or low intelligence, but even the most powerful of these accounted
	for just 0.4 per cent of the variation in intelligence between
	individuals. The six together accounted for about 1 per cent of the
	variation in intelligence. Dozens of previous studies on twins and
	adopted children have established that about half of the variation
	in intelligence is down to environment.&quot; (2007)<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	Though there are correlations between abilities useful for research
	and genetic variations, any individual genetic variation explains
	only a very small portion of differences between people in cognitive
	ability. Very large studies sequencing the genomes of hundreds of
	thousands or millions of individuals may be required to identify a
	substantial fraction of relevant variation. Some variants will be so
	rare that statistics cannot be assembled, forcing researchers to
	infer their effects from functional and other information, taking
	years after large-scale genome sequencing data become available.<BR>

	<B>Claim:</B>
	&quot;Talent-search participants
	(286 males, 94 females) scoring in the top 0.01% on
	cognitive-ability measures were identified before age 13 and tracked
	over 20 years. Their creative, occupational, and life
	accomplishments are compared with those of graduate students (299
	males, 287 females) enrolled in top-ranked U.S. mathematics,
	engineering, and physical science programs in 1992 and tracked over
	10 years. By their mid-30s, the two groups achieved comparable and
	exceptional success (e.g., securing top tenure-track positions) and
	reported high and commensurate career and life satisfaction. [...]
	Individuals identified solely on the basis of one very high SAT
	score before the age of 13 achieved occupational success comparable
	to that of individuals attending world-class mathematics, science,
	and engineering graduate training programs.&quot;<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	If there is a substantial correlation between genes and research
	ability, and this genetic material can be used to select embryos
	that will grow into adults with this exceptional ability, then the
	practical impact could be quite large. The ability multiplier for
	embryo-selected children could be as high as 100 or even
	1,000.
