<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two components are
necessary to simulate the brain successfully: hardware and software.
When will we have sufficient understanding of the brain that we can
create neuromorphic human-level AI?</P>

	<B>Claim:</B>
	&quot;Steven Rose, a neurobiologist at England's Open University,
	rejects the premise that the software of the human brain can be
	encoded in a computer. He suspects that computation occurs at scales
	above and below the level of individual neurons and synapses, via
	genetic, hormonal, and other processes.&quot;<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	The brain is so complicated, we'll never be able to get the software
	right.

	<B>Claim: </B>IBM, in cooperation with Henry
	Markram, launched a project in May 2005, Blue Brain, with the
	long-term goal of completely simulating a human brain at the
	molecular level. Their first milestone, simulating a single rat
	neocortical column, was achieved in December 2006. A 2008 article in
	SEED magazine said, &quot;But if computing speeds continue to
	develop at their current exponential pace, and energy efficiency
	improves, Markram believes that he'll be able to model a complete
	human brain on a single machine in ten years or less.&quot;<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	The entire human brain could be simulated by 2018.

	<B>Claim:</B> In April 2007, a team from the
	IBM Almaden Research Lab and the University of Nevada successfully
	simulated a crude representation of half a mouse brain on a Blue
	Gene/L supercomputer at one-tenth speed. The simulation had
	8,000,000 neurons and up to 6,300 synapses per neuron. &quot;Biologically
	consistent dynamical processes&quot; were observed.<BR>
	<B>Implication:</B>
	We may not be far from simulating a mouse brain on a computer,
	meaning that human brain simulations may not be far off. The basic
	neuroarchitecture of mouse and human brains is largely the same. The
	main difference is the size of the human brain, not the nature of
	its parts. So a successful human brain simulation may be feasible
	within a few decades or less.
