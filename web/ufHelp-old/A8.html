<h2>How your answers was used to produce the timeline above:</h2>

<p>In <strong>Q7</strong> you entered the probability of nuclear war halting scientific progress over time, while you 
estimated the risk of non-nuclear catastrophes over time in <strong>Q8</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../img/A8.png" alt="Overview of process" /></p>
<p>These probabilities are assumed to be independent in this model and are combined 
to produce the overall probability that any type of catastrophe will have halted 
scientific progress at various points in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">*The probabilities aren't just added, see <a target="_blank" href="../coming-soon.html">math details</a> for more information.</p>
