<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that we have your
probability distribution for when neuromorphic AI will be created,
the next step is to pick a probability distribution for the creation
of non-neuromorphic human-level AI -- that is, human-level AI
designed by either implementing a theory of intelligence that works
or reverse-engineering the brain at some broad level, rather than
just directly copying the brain in as much detail as possible and
running it as software.</P>

	<B>Claim:</B> &quot;Am
	I disappointed by the amount of progress in cognitive science and AI
	in the past 30 years or so? Not at all. To the contrary, I would
	have been extremely upset if we had come anywhere close to reaching
	human intelligence -- it would have made me fear that our minds and
	souls were not deep. Reaching the goal of AI in just a few decades
	would have made me dramatically lose respect for humanity, and I
	certainly don't want (and never wanted) that to happen. Do I still
	believe it will happen someday? I can't say for sure, but I suppose
	it will eventually, yes. I wouldn't want to be around then, though.
	Indeed, I am very glad that we still have a very very long ways to
	go in our quest for AI.&quot;<BR>

	likely to be developed in the next 60 years.
