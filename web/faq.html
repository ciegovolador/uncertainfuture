				<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>1. What is this?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This website contains
an interactive modeling program used to describe how the future might
unfold based on the userâ€™s inputs.  The key focus is Artificial
Intelligence, but some questions and outputs also take into account
human intelligence enhancement and extinction risk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the questions
in this model do not have answers widely agreed upon in the
scientific community.  We challenge users to think and examine their
own assumptions when they input the modeling data.  Then, the output
shows some of the implications of these assumptions.  Users can go
back and input different data and get a different output.  The goal
is to experiment, have fun, and learn something about future
possibilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>2. Who are you?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We are a research
team that built this project over Summer 2008 using a research grant
provided by the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. 
Anna Salamon led a team consisting of Steve Rayhawk, Tom McCabe,
Michael Anissimov, Bryan Bishop, and Rolf Nelson.  Additional
consultation was provided by Michael Vassar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>3.  Why are most of
the inputs probability distributions?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because reality is
uncertain, and many of the questions have answers that no one knows
exactly.  The focus of this model is to embrace uncertainty, rather
than sweep it under the rug, as is done by futurists who set rigid
timelines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>4.  What determined
how you selected the user's guide arguments?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We tried our best to
pick arguments that summarize the major positions held by thinkers on
these topics, and to achieve balance by presenting a range of views. 
Including every view held by everyone who has ever thought on these
matters is impossible, so we tried to limit the arguments for each
question to fit on one or two pages.</P>
